Burner Wallet research

Generates an Ethereum wallet in your browser if you don't have MetaMask or Trust web3 injected.

Lets you send and receive funds with an ephemeral account. 

If you are out to dinner and you need to send/receive a quick amount of ETH/DAI, open up https://qreth.io and do so. 

BUT! Make sure you sweep the account later that night to a cold wallet and burn the private key!

The purpose of this is to research and understand quick, throw-away wallets, and their use in the real world!

DAI is running on the POA xDAI side chain on https://xdai.io
